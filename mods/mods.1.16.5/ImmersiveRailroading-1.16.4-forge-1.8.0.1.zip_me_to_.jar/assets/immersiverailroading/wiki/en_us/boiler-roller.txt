The Boiler Roller turns Boiler Plates created in the [link{immersiverailroading:plate-rolling-machine}]Plate Rolling Machine[link{}] into the needed boiler pieces for a given steam locomotive.

It is built from:
* 24 x Stone Slab
*  4 x Heavy Engineering Block
*  8 x Light Engineering Block

To operate, the machine needs RF/IF power, which is input through the orange-yellow colored block on the left front of the machine. The roller creates the appropriate part automatically - just have a boilerplate in hand and right-click the machine. After a few moments, the flat plate will be rolled - right-click the machine with an empty hand to pick it up.
