The Locomotive Control Augment is used to set the throttle or brake of locomotives overhead.  Right click on a track segment to apply the augment.  It can be filtered by right clicking on the augment with a locomotive item.

Right clicking on the augment with a redstone torch will switch it between a few modes:
* Throttle Forward: Sets the throttle forward proportional to the redstone signal
* Throttle Reverse: Sets the throttle reverse proportional to the redstone signal
* Brake: Sets the brake proportional to the redstone signal
* Horn: Fires off the whistle or horn regardless of redstone level
* Computer: see [link{immersiverailroading:open-computers}]Open Computers Integration[link{}]
