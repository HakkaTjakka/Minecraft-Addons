The Detector Augment is used to check what locomotive/stock is passing overhead.  Right click on a track segment to apply the augment.  It can be filtered by right clicking on the augment with a locomotive or rolling stock item.

By default, the detector outputs a redstone signal of there is a locomotive or other stock above it.

It can be re-configured to output redstone proportional to a few different events:

* Speed
* Number of passengers
* Freight Cargo fullness
* Liquid Cargo fullness

This is accomplished by right-clicking the augment with a redstone torch
