The Item Loader/Unloader Augments are used to interface with the inventory of the locomotive or stock which is overhead.  Right click on a track segment to apply the augment.  It can be filtered by right clicking on the augment with a locomotive or rolling stock item.

The augments do not pull from adjacent inventories, nor do they push to adjacent inventories.
