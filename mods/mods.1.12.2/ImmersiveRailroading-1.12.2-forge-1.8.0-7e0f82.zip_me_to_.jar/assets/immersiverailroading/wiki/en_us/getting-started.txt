Before establishing a railroad empire, it's a good idea to ensure a robust supply of Steel, Treated Wood, and electrical power.

When ready, create a [link{immersiverailroading:blueprint-book}]Blueprint Book[link{}], a [link{immersiverailroading:large-wrench}]Large Wrench[link{}], and a [link{immersiverailroading:track-blueprint}]Track Blueprint[link{}]. These three tools are essential to progress and construction through the mod.

Setting up a clear, level space at least 2 chunks by 2 chunks is recommended.  This will provide enough space for constructing machinery and rolling stock. The first machines you will need are the [link{immersiverailroading:casting-basin}]Casting Basin[link{}] and [link{immersiverailroading:track-roller}]Track Roller[link{}] to create tracks. Making tracks requires a Rail Casting, which is made in the Casting Basin.

Next, place down at least 2 lengths of track end-to-end to have enough space to place a Frame on the rails, which is created in the Casting Basin. Make sure your Frame and Track gauges match up! With the Frame in hand, right-click the rail to place it. Then, with the Large Wrench in hand, right-click the Frame. It will list the parts needed to complete the piece of stock and which machines are needed in order to make those parts. For example, a newly placed A1 Peppercorn Frame will list out that it needs 2 Cylinders, which are made in the Casting Basin and then processed in the [link{immersiverailroading:steam-hammer}]Steam Hammer[link{}].

Continuing on with the creation of an A1 Peppercorn, we don't need another machine until we get to the point of creating the engine's firebox and boiler, using the [link{immersiverailroading:boiler-roller}]Boiler Roller[link{}] and [link{immersiverailroading:plate-rolling-machine}]Plate Rolling Machine[link{}].

A word of warning: Steam Engines require a constant water supply when fueled, and if they boil off 75% or more of their water, there is a chance that they will explode. As such, it's a good idea to remove any fuel from idle Steam Engines, or ensure they have a constant supply of water through a Loader and fluid piping.

Locomotives and cars can be instantly removed and picked up by using sneak + click on them.
